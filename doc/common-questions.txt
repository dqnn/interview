BackTracking vs DFS

Usually, a depth-first-search is a way of iterating through an actual graph/tree structure looking for a value, 
whereas backtracking is iterating through a problem space looking for a solution. 
Backtracking is a more general algorithm that doesn't necessarily even relate to trees.
