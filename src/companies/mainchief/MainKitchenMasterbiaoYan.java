 * Problem Description
Challenge Prompt
Create a real-time system that emulates the fulfillment of 
delivery orders for a kitchen. The kitchen should receive 
2 delivery orders per second. The kitchen should instantly 
cook the order upon receiving it, and then place 
the order on the best-available shelf (see Shelves section) 
to await pick up by a courier. Upon receiving an order, 
the system should dispatch a courier to pick up and deliver 
that specific order. The courier should arrive randomly between 
2-6 seconds later. The courier should instantly pick up the 
order upon arrival. Once an order is picked up, the courier 
should instantly deliver it.
You can use any programming language, framework, and IDE 

you’d like; however, we strongly discourage the use of 
microservices, kafka, REST APIs, RPCs, DBs, etc due to time 
constraints.
Orders
You can download a JSON file of food order structures from 
http://bit.ly/css_dto_orders. Orders must be parsed from the 
file and ingested into your system at a rate of 2 orders per 
second. You are expected to make your order ingestion rate 
configurable, so that we can test your system’s behavior 
with different ingestion rates. Each order should only be 
ingested once; when all orders have been consumed, your 
system should terminate.
Example:
"order.json"
{
{
    "id": "a8cfcb76-7f24-4420-a5ba-d46dd77bdffd",
    "name": "Banana Split",
    "temp": "frozen", ​// Preferred shelf storage temperature
    "shelfLife": 20, /​/ Shelf wait max duration (seconds)
    "decayRate": 0.63 /​/ Value deterioration modifier
}
}
Shelves
The kitchen pick-up area has multiple shelves to hold cooked orders 
at different temperatures. Each order should be placed on a shelf that
 matches the order’s temperature. If that shelf is full, an order can be
  placed on the overflow shelf. If the overflow shelf is full, an existing order 
  of your choosing on the overflow should be moved to an allowable shelf with room. 
  If no such move is possible, a random order from the overflow shelf should be 
  discarded as waste (and will not be available for a ‍‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‌‌‍‍‍‍courier pickup).
The following table details the kitchen’s shelves:
Name Allowable Temperatures Capacity
Hot shelf hot 10
Cold shelf cold 10
Frozen shelf frozen 10
Overflow shelf any temperature 15
Shelf Life
Orders have an inherent value that will deteriorate over time, 
based on the order’s shelfLife and decayRate fields. Orders that have reached 
a value of zero are considered wasted: they should never be delivered and 
should be removed from the shelf. Please display the current order value when 
displaying an order in your system’s output.
value = (shelfLife - decayRate * orderAge * shelfDecayModifier) / shelfLife
Important: shelfDecayModifier is 1 for single-temperature shelves and 2 
for the overflow shelf.
