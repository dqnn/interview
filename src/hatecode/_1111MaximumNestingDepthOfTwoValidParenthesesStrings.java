1111. Maximum Nesting Depth of Two Valid Parentheses Strings
A string is a valid parentheses string (denoted VPS) if and only if it consists of "(" and ")" characters only, and:

It is the empty string, or
It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are VPS's, or
It can be written as (A), where A is a VPS.
We can similarly define the nesting depth depth(S) of any VPS S as follows:

depth("") = 0
depth(A + B) = max(depth(A), depth(B)), where A and B are VPS's
depth("(" + A + ")") = 1 + depth(A), where A is a VPS.
For example,  "", "()()", and "()(()())" are VPS's (with nesting depths 0, 1, and 2), and ")(" and "(()" are not VPS's.

 

Given a VPS seq, split it into two disjoint subsequences A and B, such that A and B are VPS's (and A.length + B.length = seq.length).

Now choose any such A and B such that max(depth(A), depth(B)) is the minimum possible value.

Return an answer array (of length seq.length) that encodes such a choice of A and B:  answer[i] = 0 if seq[i] is part of A, else answer[i] = 1.  Note that even though multiple answers may exist, you may return any of them.

 

Example 1:

Input: seq = "(()())"
Output: [0,1,1,1,1,0]
*/
    //thinking process: O(n)/O(1)
    //follow is the example to demonstrate the problem, so we define VPS concept, 
    //which means parenthsis can concat, include each other still valid. 
    //so given an string of parenthese, we can extract them into A+B model, the depth is max(A, B)
    //so return an array, res[i] = 0 if seq[0] is part of A, else 1

 * Example 1:

    ( ( ) ( ) )                 "(()())"

  [ 0 1 1 1 1 0 ]

A:  (         )                 "()"
B:    ( ) ( )                   "()()"

Example 2:

    ( ) ( ( ) ) ( )             "()(())()"

  [ 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 ]

A:  ( ) (     )                 "()()"
B:        ( )   ( )             "()()"

    //look at this example, (((()))), since multiple answers exists, so lets suppose depth(A) ã€‹= depth(B),
    // for this example, how can achieve min(dep(A), dep(B)), if total depth is even, then dep(A) =dep(B) = totalDep/2,
    //   ( ( ( ( ) ) ) )  will be like following, so we mark even->B, odd-.A
    //   (   (     )   )     A
   //      (   ( )   )       B
   // so we can know if i as index of seq, if i & 1 == 1 means odd,
