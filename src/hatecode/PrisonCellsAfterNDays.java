957. Prison Cells After N Days
There are 8 prison cells in a row, and each cell is either occupied or vacant.

Each day, whether the cell is occupied or vacant changes according to the following rules:

If a cell has two adjacent neighbors that are both occupied or both vacant, then the cell becomes occupied.
Otherwise, it becomes vacant.
(Note that because the prison is a row, the first and the last cells in the row can't have two adjacent neighbors.)

We describe the current state of the prison in the following way: cells[i] == 1 if the i-th cell is occupied, else cells[i] == 0.

Given the initial state of the prison, return the state of the prison after N days (and N such changes described above.)

 

Example 1:

Input: cells = [0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1], N = 7
Output: [0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]
Explanation: 
The following table summarizes the state of the prison on each day:
Day 0: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
Day 1: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Day 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
Day 3: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
Day 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
Day 5: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
Day 6: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
Day 7: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

    //interview friendly, thinking process: 
    
    //so we have an array, and it will change to 1 if both neighbours
    //are the same, not will be 0, N is the times it needs to change,
    //return the result. note: first and last digit does not change
    
    
    //this is typical question that it will have periodï¼Œsince the
    //states will only have 2^6 = 64 states overall, so the brutal force
    //is just to simulate the whole computation, then thinking about optimization,
    //with period, so we can use Map to store all possible results, if we meet again,
    //which means the diff is the length of the period then we can take advantage of 
    //the period to advance the last cycle, 
    
    //another optimization is 1, 7, 14, currently only brute force
