public class _332ReconstructItinerary {

    /**
     * Given a list of airline tickets represented by pairs of departure and arrival airports [from, to],
     * reconstruct the itinerary in order. All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from JFK.
     * Thus, the itinerary must begin with JFK.

     Note:
     If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that
     has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string. For example,
     the itinerary ["JFK", "LGA"] has a smaller lexical order than ["JFK", "LGB"].
     All airports are represented by three capital letters (IATA code).
     You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary.

     Example 1:
     tickets = [["MUC", "LHR"], ["JFK", "MUC"], ["SFO", "SJC"], ["LHR", "SFO"]]
     Return ["JFK", "MUC", "LHR", "SFO", "SJC"].

     Example 2:
     tickets = [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]
     Return ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"].

     Another possible reconstruction is ["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"].
     But it is larger in lexical order.

    // so the whole problem is we want to find one possible routine which starts from "JFK"
    // given array which [start, end] format, sometimes the guy will fly back and again so it

    //poll to change the graph, another reason to use PQ is smallest lexi order

    //one quick answer to copu the PQ every time, :-) need time to think about other solutions
