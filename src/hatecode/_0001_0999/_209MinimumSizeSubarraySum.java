    /**
Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s, 
find the minimal length of a contiguous 
subarray of which the sum â‰¥ s. If there isn't one, return 0 instead.

Example: 

Input: s = 7, A = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the 
problem constraint.

If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution of which 
the time complexity is O(n log n). 

     time : O(n)
     space : O(1)
