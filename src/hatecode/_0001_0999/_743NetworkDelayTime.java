743. Network Delay Time
There are N network nodes, labelled 1 to N.

Given times, a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (u, v, w), where u is the source node, v is the target node, 
and w is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.

Now, we send a signal from a certain node K. How long will it take for all nodes to receive the signal? If it is impossible, return -1.

Note:

    //TODOï¼šadd Dij solution since it has better complexity
/*
bellman time complexity is O(VE) and Dijkstra Algo has O(ElogV)in case of maxheap is used.
Bellman does relaxation for n-1 times and Dijkstra Algo only 1 time.
Bellman can handle negative weights but Dijkstra Algo can't.
Bellman visit a vertex more then once but Dijkstra Algo only once.

   /*
    * interview frinendly: 

      the problem is to say: given list of tuple [i,j,k] means from node i -> j, time cost is k,
      then given source node and total n nodes, return the min time that singal can travel all nodes

      it is easy to think about BFS since you want to visit all adjacent nodes at one wave.
      but that is not good enough, because
      1. travel time cost is not the same, some are faster while some are slower
      2. some nodes may have multiple paths from source to this node, and they have different time cost, we prefer lower one
      3. how we can use mem to avoid double visit or repeated adding to queue


      we use inQueue[i] to indicate whether i is already in queue, if already in queue then we do not 
      have to add i into queue again, but note: we actually we do not need inQueue because everytime
      we will update the dist[i] whenever we have a shorter path.

      so we avoid add duplicated node to queue but we always update dist[v] to have a smaller value which
     means we already processed this case, we do not need to process again.
     dist[i] is the key, 

        
        \    /
        3\  / 4
           5

    no matter which comes to 5, we will dist[5] = 3, we do not have add 5 into queue again, because 
    we already updated dist[5], if add again then it is totally duplicated
