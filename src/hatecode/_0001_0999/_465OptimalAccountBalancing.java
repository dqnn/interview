    /*
     * 465. Optimal Account Balancing A group of friends went on holiday and
     * sometimes lent each other money. For example, Alice paid for Bill's lunch for
     * $10. Then later Chris gave Alice $5 for a taxi ride. We can model each
     * transaction as a tuple (x, y, z) which means person x gave person y $z.
     * Assuming Alice, Bill, and Chris are person 0, 1, and 2 respectively (0, 1, 2
     * are the person's ID), the transactions can be represented as [[0, 1, 10], [2,
     * 0, 5]].
     * 
     * Given a list of transactions between a group of people, return the minimum
     * number of transactions required to settle the debt.
     * 
     * Note:
     * 
     * A transaction will be given as a tuple (x, y, z). Note that x â‰  y and z > 0.
     * Person's IDs may not be linear, e.g. we could have the persons 0, 1, 2 or we
     * could also have the persons 0, 2, 6. Input: [[0,1,10], [1,0,1], [1,2,5],
     * [2,0,5]]
     * 
     * Output: 1
