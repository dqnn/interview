710. Random Pick with Blacklist
Given a blacklist B containing unique integers from [0, N), write a function to return a uniform random integer from [0, N) which is NOT in B.

Optimize it such that it minimizes the call to systemâ€™s Math.random().

Note:

1 <= N <= 1000000000
0 <= B.length < min(100000, N)
[0, N) does NOT include N. See interval notation.
Example 1:

Input: 
["Solution","pick","pick","pick"]
[[1,[]],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,0,0,0]

    //O(B)/O(B), 
    //so given 0->N-1 number, we have a black list, so we want to random pick number same probability while not in blacklist
    
    //so considering the length M = N -b.length, so rnd.nextInt(M) should give us good indicator where it is. 
    //so suppse N = 5, B =1, and M = 4, think about this way, if there is no blacklist, then nextInt is the answer, 
    //if blacklist contains someInteger, then we have to shift the the nextInt(M), so we have a map to map to next correct answer,
    //to save cost, we do this in the constructor. this is the mechanism, 
    
    //when  call pick. we choose one random number from 0-M-1, you can think this is the index of numbers in 0-N-1, the correct 
    //thinking is that 3->4 while 5->6 next un-blacklist number is the target.
