    /**
     * Given a nested list of integers, return the sum of all integers in the list weighted by their depth.

     Each element is either an integer, or a list -- whose elements may also be integers or other lists.

     Different from the previous question where weight is increasing from root to leaf, now the weight is defined from bottom up. i.e., the leaf level integers have weight 1, and the root level integers have the largest weight.

     Example 1:
     Given the list [[1,1],2,[1,1]], return 8. (four 1's at depth 1, one 2 at depth 2)

     Example 2:
     Given the list [1,[4,[6]]], return 17.
     (one 1 at depth 3, one 4 at depth 2, and one 6 at depth 1; 1*3 + 4*2 + 6*1 = 17)

     DFS 2 + DFS(2, Nest)
       DFS 2 +

     nextList : 1, 1, 1, 1

     res = 2 + 2 + 4
        dfs(next, 2) res = 2 + 4

    //the key of the problem is to understand how to pass the current level 
    //value to next level without knowing the exact current level value,
    //we use a trick here that when going to next level, we use sum in current level, 
    //in next level, we add sum again. note: sum + sum + sum != sum x2 x 2...

    //the problem is reversly sum, the leaf will be last level, and the root will 
    //have the highest level, we can also try top-down accumulate the level, but it sounds 
    //will have 2nd visit, first to make sure the each node level, seond is sum them up.

    //[[1,2],3,[1,2]],
