     * 947. Most Stones Removed with Same Row or Column 
     * On a 2D plane, we place stones at some integer coordinate points. Each coordinate 
     * point may have at most one stone.
     * 
     * Now, a move consists of removing a stone that shares a column or row with
     * another stone on the grid.
     * 
     * What is the largest possible number of moves we can make?
     * 
     * Example 1:
     * 
     * Input: stones = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[2,2]] Output: 5
     * 
     * Problem: we can remove a stone if and only if, there is another stone in the
     * same column OR row. We try to remove as many as stones as possible.
     * 
     * 
     * One sentence to solve: Connected stones can be reduced to 1 stone, the
     * maximum stones can be removed = stones number - islands number. so just count
     * the number of "islands".
     * 
     * 1. Connected stones Two stones are connected if they are in the same row or
     * same col. Connected stones will build a connected graph. It's obvious that in
     * one connected graph, we can't remove all stones.
     * 
     * We have to have one stone left. An intuition is that, in the best strategy,
     * we can remove until 1 stone.
     * 
     * I guess you may reach this step when solving the problem. But the important
     * question is, how?
     * 
     * 2. A failed strategy Try to remove the least degree stone Like a tree, we try
     * to remove leaves first. Some new leaf generated. We continue this process
     * until the root node left.
     * 
     * However, there can be no leaf. When you try to remove the least in-degree
     * stone, it won't work on this "8" like graph: [[1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0,
     * 0], [0, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]]
     * 
     * The stone in the center has least degree = 2. But if you remove this stone
     * first, the whole connected stones split into 2 parts, and you will finish
     * with 2 stones left.
     * 
     * 3. A good strategy In fact, the proof is really straightforward. You probably
     * apply a DFS, from one stone to next connected stone. You can remove stones in
     * reversed order. In this way, all stones can be removed but the stone that you
     * start your DFS.
     * 
     * One more step of explanation: In the view of DFS, a graph is explored in the
     * structure of a tree. As we discussed previously, a tree can be removed in
     * topological order, from leaves to root.
     * 
     * 4. Count the number of islands We call a connected graph as an island. One
     * island must have at least one stone left. The maximum stones can be removed =
     * stones number - islands number
     * 
     * The whole problem is transferred to: What is the number of islands?
     * 
     * You can show all your skills on a DFS implementation, and solve this problem
     * as a normal one.
     * 
     * 5. Unify index Struggle between rows and cols? You may duplicate your codes
     * when you try to the same thing on rows and cols. In fact, no logical
     * difference between col index and rows index.
     * 
     * An easy trick is that, add 10000 to col index. So we use 0 ~ 9999 for row
     * index and 10000 ~ 19999 for col.
     * 
     * 6. Search on the index, not the points When we search on points, we
     * alternately change our view on a row and on a col.
     * 
     * We think: a row index, connect two stones on this row a col index, connect
     * two stones on this col.
     * 
     * In another viewï¼š A stone, connect a row index and col.
     * 
     * Have this idea in mind, the solution can be much simpler. The number of
     * islands of points, is the same as the number of islands of indexes.
     * 
     * 7. Union-Find I use union find to solve this problem. As I mentioned, the
     * elements are not the points, but the indexes.
     * 
     * for each point, union two indexes. return points number - union number Copy a
     * template of union-find, write 2 lines above, you can solve this problem in
     * several minutes.
