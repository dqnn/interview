1042. Flower Planting With No Adjacent
You have N gardens, labelled 1 to N.  In each garden, you want to plant one of 4 types of flowers.

paths[i] = [x, y] describes the existence of a bidirectional path from garden x to garden y.

Also, there is no garden that has more than 3 paths coming into or leaving it.

Your task is to choose a flower type for each garden such that, for any two gardens connected by a path, they have different types of flowers.

Return any such a choice as an array answer, where answer[i] is the type of flower planted in the (i+1)-th garden.  The flower types are denoted 1, 2, 3, or 4.  It is guaranteed an answer exists.

 

Example 1:

Input: N = 3, paths = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: [1,2,3]
*/
  //thinking process: 
    //given one integer N stands for flowers type, another 2D array
    //stands for connected gardens, each garden has different typeof flowers
    //so return one flower type as array for all gardens
    
    //
    public int[] gardenNoAdj(int N, int[][] paths) {
        Map<Integer, Set<Integer>> G = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) G.put(i, new HashSet<>());
        for (int[] p : paths) {
            G.get(p[0] - 1).add(p[1] - 1);
            G.get(p[1] - 1).add(p[0] - 1);
        }
        //
        int[] res = new int[N];
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            int[] colors = new int[5];
            for (int j : G.get(i))
                colors[res[j]] = 1;
            for (int c = 4; c > 0; --c)
                if (colors[c] == 0)
                    res[i] = c;
        }
        return res;
    }
