     * 855. Exam Room 
     * In an exam room, there are N seats in a single row, numbered
     * 0, 1, 2, ..., N-1.
     * 
     * When a student enters the room, they must sit in the seat that maximizes the
     * distance to the closest person. If there are multiple such seats, they sit in
     * the seat with the lowest number. (Also, if no one is in the room, then the
     * student sits at seat number 0.)
     * 
     * Return a class ExamRoom(int N) that exposes two functions: ExamRoom.seat()
     * returning an int representing what seat the student sat in, and
     * ExamRoom.leave(int p) representing that the student in seat number p now
     * leaves the room. It is guaranteed that any calls to ExamRoom.leave(p) have a
     * student sitting in seat p.
     * 
     * Input: ["ExamRoom","seat","seat","seat","seat","leave","seat"],
     * [[10],[],[],[],[],[4],[]] Output: [null,0,9,4,2,null,5] Explanation:
     * ExamRoom(10) -> null seat() -> 0, no one is in the room, then the student
     * sits at seat number 0. seat() -> 9, the student sits at the last seat number
     * 9. seat() -> 4, the student sits at the last seat number 4. seat() -> 2, the
     * student sits at the last seat number 2. leave(4) -> null seat() -> 5, the
     * student sits at the last seat number 5.

   // give a row of seats with number 0->n-1 in a exam room, seat() will allocate one seat for a 
    //student so he has maxium distance to his/her closest student. leave(int ) means the student
    //left the room, the seat will be empty
    
    //so thinking from small example, it is empty, seat() will return 0, seat() return N-1 as second
    //then it is middle, then first middle.....
    
    //so the allocation is relatively fixed pattern. if we thinking the thread is segment,so 
    //there are a lot of intervals when we call seat() and leave() functions. 
    // interval has start, end and len attributes. if we use this data structure how we implement 
    //seat() and leave, for seat, we want to allocate one postion which has max distance to closet
    //position, so if we sort the segment intervals by distance, so we would get conclusion that
