1114. Print in Order
Suppose we have a class:

public class Foo {
  public void first() { print("first"); }
  public void second() { print("second"); }
  public void third() { print("third"); }
}
The same instance of Foo will be passed to three different threads. Thread A will call first(), thread B will call second(), and thread C will call third(). Design a mechanism and modify the program to ensure that second() is executed after first(), and third() is executed after second().

 

Example 1:

Input: [1,2,3]
Output: "firstsecondthird"

Example 2:

Input: [1,3,2]
Output: "firstsecondthird"

    //just use semaphore or lock to release or acquire the lockï¼Œ
    //the key is output is always the same no matter the sequence of 1,2, 3.  see example 2. 
    //so how can i make sure the output order is guaranteed?
    //one way is to have dependency, third->second->first, so no matter which sequence, it alwyas
    //will seek dependency ready, recursive way
    
    //just think we have 3 boxes in a line, we want to open as above sequence, 
    //so if we random choose 1, if it is 3, then we do not print, we want to see its dependency,
    //to look for 2, so random open 2nd box, if it is 2 then good, when we print, we found we need to 
    //print 1, as this recursion goes, we can find the last one.
    
    //so  --1--  --2--  --3-- how can we insert dependency?
