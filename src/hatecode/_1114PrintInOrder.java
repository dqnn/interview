1114. Print in Order
Suppose we have a class:

public class Foo {
  public void first() { print("first"); }
  public void second() { print("second"); }
  public void third() { print("third"); }
}
The same instance of Foo will be passed to three different threads. Thread A will call first(), thread B will call second(), and thread C will call third(). Design a mechanism and modify the program to ensure that second() is executed after first(), and third() is executed after second().

 

Example 1:

Input: [1,2,3]
Output: "firstsecondthird"

    //just use semphore or lock to release or acquire the lock
    Semaphore run2, run3;

    public _1114PrintInOrder() {
        run2 = new Semaphore(0);
        run3 = new Semaphore(0);
    }

    public void first(Runnable printFirst) throws InterruptedException {
        printFirst.run();
        run2.release();
    }

    public void second(Runnable printSecond) throws InterruptedException {
        run2.acquire();
        printSecond.run();
        run3.release();
    }

    public void third(Runnable printThird) throws InterruptedException {
        run3.acquire(); 
        printThird.run();
    }
