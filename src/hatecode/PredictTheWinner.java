486. Predict the Winner
Given an array of scores that are non-negative integers. Player 1 picks one of the numbers from either end of the array followed by the player 2 and then player 1 and so on. Each time a player picks a number, that number will not be available for the next player. This continues until all the scores have been chosen. The player with the maximum score wins.

Given an array of scores, predict whether player 1 is the winner. You can assume each player plays to maximize his score.

Example 1:
Input: [1, 5, 2]
Output: False
Explanation: Initially, player 1 can choose between 1 and 2. 
If he chooses 2 (or 1), then player 2 can choose from 1 (or 2) and 5. If player 2 chooses 5, then player 1 will be left with 1 (or 2). 
So, final score of player 1 is 1 + 2 = 3, and player 2 is 5. 
Hence, player 1 will never be the winner and you need to return False.

    //thinking process: two players A and B and one given array, each time A or B can get first or last from array, at least
    //whose sum is bigger who will win, so return whether A will win or not
    
    //so suppose array is 1,5,4,8, so A have n/2 times to get one number, so total states will be O(2^n)/O(n), 
    //we use diff = first- sec >= 0, no tie, first would only have 2 choices, 1 or 8, so we use a and b to stands for.
