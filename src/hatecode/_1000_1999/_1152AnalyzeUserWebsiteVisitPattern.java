1152. Analyze User Website Visit Pattern
We are given some website visits: the user with name username[i] visited the website website[i] at time timestamp[i].

A 3-sequence is a list of websites of length 3 sorted in ascending order by the time of their visits.  (The websites in a 3-sequence are not necessarily distinct.)

Find the 3-sequence visited by the largest number of users. If there is more than one solution, return the lexicographically smallest such 3-sequence.

 

Example 1:

Input: username = ["joe","joe","joe","james","james","james","james","mary","mary","mary"], timestamp = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], website = ["home","about","career","home","cart","maps","home","home","about","career"]
Output: ["home","about","career"]

    //so what we have to do is to collect each users web visited and sort by timestamp,
    //then we use use another map<visitPattern, Integer> to record the count and output the max
    
    //note: we need to use set for each user, because map may overlap with users, but 
    //max should be max visit pattern for each user, not for all
