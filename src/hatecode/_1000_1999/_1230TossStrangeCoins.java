 * 1230. Toss Strange Coins
    You have some coins.  The i-th coin has a probability 
    prob[i] of facing heads when tossed.
    
    Return the probability that the number of coins facing 
    heads equals target if you toss every coin exactly once.
    
    Example 1:
    
    Input: prob = [0.4], target = 1
    Output: 0.40000
    
    Input: prob = [0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5], target = 0
    Output: 0.03125
