1116. Print Zero Even Odd
Suppose you are given the following code:


The same instance of ZeroEvenOdd will be passed to three different threads:

Thread A will call zero() which should only output 0's.
Thread B will call even() which should only output even numbers.
Thread C will call odd() which should only output odd numbers.
Each of the threads is given a printNumber method to output an integer. Modify the given program to output the series 010203040506... where the length of the series must be 2n.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: "0102"
*/
    // thinking process: 
    //the problem is to say: given 3 threads with 3 functions and an integer n, 
    //zero function will print 0, even will print even number and 
    //odd will print odd number, we would like to print such form like
    //"0102030405" n = 5 string,
    
    //so the key is how to control the print flow, we need some control signal to 
    //allow each function can be executed
    
    //even or odd will only be executed n / 2 time but 0 will be executed n times
    
    //thinking 3 threads already existsï¼Œnow we want them to print each function below, 
    //so we just need to control when can print with signal inside these 3 functions
    //zero has 1 initially because it will print first, others will be blocked. 
    //same logic with 1115
