998. Maximum Binary Tree II
We are given the root node of a maximum tree: a tree where every node has a value greater than any other 
value in its subtree.

Just as in the previous problem, the given tree was constructed from an list A (root = Construct(A)) recursively with the following Construct(A) routine:

If A is empty, return null.
Otherwise, let A[i] be the largest element of A.  Create a root node with value A[i].
The left child of root will be Construct([A[0], A[1], ..., A[i-1]])
The right child of root will be Construct([A[i+1], A[i+2], ..., A[A.length - 1]])
Return root.
Note that we were not given A directly, only a root node root = Construct(A).

Suppose B is a copy of A with the value val appended to it.  It is guaranteed that B has unique values.

Return Construct(B).
Example 1:
Input: root = [4,1,3,null,null,2], val = 5
Output: [5,4,null,1,3,null,null,2]
Explanation: A = [1,4,2,3], B = [1,4,2,3,5]
