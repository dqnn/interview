    /*
     * 765. Couples Holding Hands N couples sit in 2N seats arranged in a row and
     * want to hold hands. We want to know the minimum number of swaps so that every
     * couple is sitting side by side. A swap consists of choosing any two people,
     * then they stand up and switch seats.
     * 
     * The people and seats are represented by an integer from 0 to 2N-1, the
     * couples are numbered in order, the first couple being (0, 1), the second
     * couple being (2, 3), and so on with the last couple being (2N-2, 2N-1).
     * 
     * The couples' initial seating is given by row[i] being the value of the person
     * who is initially sitting in the i-th seat.
     * 
     * Example 1:
     * 
     * Input: row = [0, 2, 1, 3] Output: 1
