936. Stamping The Sequence
For example, if the sequence is "ababc", and the stamp is "abc", then we could return the answer [0, 2], corresponding to the moves "?????" -> "abc??" -> "ababc".

Also, if the sequence is possible to stamp, it is guaranteed it is possible to stamp within 10 * target.length moves.  Any answers specifying more than this number of moves will not be accepted.

 

Example 1:

Input: stamp = "abc", target = "ababc"
Output: [0,2]
([1,0,2] would also be accepted as an answer, as well as some other answers.)

    //thinking process: 
    //given a target string "ababc" and stamp string "abc", so suppose there is same length string as target, called it pre-target = "****", each time we can copy "abc" to overwrite the pre-target, so what's min number of ops to pre-target = target,return list of index which are needed for the min ops
    
    //TODO brute force solution is ....
    //TODO: DFS:
    //optimal oneï¼š it is not easy to think through how we can from "*****"-> "ababc" by "abc", but if we can try different pos and overrite smaller part of target which is not equals to target, this is the direction
