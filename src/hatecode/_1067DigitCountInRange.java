1067. Digit Count in Range
233.
Given an integer d between 0 and 9, and two positive integers low and high as lower and upper bounds, respectively. Return the number of times that d occurs as a digit in all integers between low and high, including the bounds low and high.
 

Example 1:

Input: d = 1, low = 1, high = 13
Output: 6
